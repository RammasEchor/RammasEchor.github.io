## Learning how to learn

### Focused and Diffused Thinking

Metaphors help us learn by binding concepts to things we know.

There are two types of thinking:

- Focused: This is where we give something we want to learn all of our attention.
- Diffused: You take a step back, and just think about the general idea. This enables you to let your brain create new ways of thinking, because your mind wanders in those ways.

For example, Dal√≠ let his mind wander with a key in his hand, and when he was about to fall sleep, the falling key would wake him up and he would gather all those diffused thinking ideas and bring them to the focused mode.

To reach this state, it is important to practice. The brain has evolved to help us navigate complex environments, and almost all of this happens in the subconscious, so it is not easy to do it at will.

### Procrastination

The procrastination loop:

- You feel uncomfortable doing the task
- You switch tasks
- You feel better, and remember that that first task make you feel uncomfortable

The Pomodoro tool to beat this: do the task 25 minutes, then reward yourself with 5 minutes of leisure tasks.

### Practice makes permanent

Because concepts sometimes don't have a representation in the real world, it is difficult for us to understand them; like math, we can't see a derivate in the flesh, but we can practice to strengthen the connections in our brains.

The more abstract something is, the more important is to practice it to bring those abstract ideas into reality.

### Introduction to memory

Two concepts:

- Working memory: What you're consciously and immediately processing in your mind.
- Long term memory: Like a storage warehouse. This is where you store concepts that relates with what you're working with today.

### Sleep and learning

Sleep is the way for the brain to clean itself. If you don't sleep, you're learning with a brain that is not working good.
Sleeping allows you to learn better and faster. It consolidates memories into the brain, so that they pass from the working memory to the long term memory.

### Testimonies

In this section of the course, I learned about how different people learn, how they apply the information of this course and changed the way they learn. Each one of them had a different history to tell, and I really enjoyed reading them.

### Introduction to chunking

A chunk is the result of grouping bits of information together, and give meaning to them. This makes easier the chunk to integrate with new information we're learning. Focusing the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of learning. This chunk is meant to be recalled smoothly when we want to use it, and this is achieved via practice and repetition.

A chunk is a little piece of something that it is easy to remember. Then, you can group more chunks to to reach the concept, or the song, or that something you want to learn.

Steps for chunking:

- Focus learn the information you want to chunk.
- Understand the basic idea to chunk.
- Gain context on when you can use this chunk, via practice.

### Illusions of competence

Illusions of competence means that we may trick us into thinking that we are learning when in reality we just associate, for example, having a book in front of us with learning.

There are some tips for really learning:

- Recalling: Read a text and try to recall it. Then read it again and try to recall it again. The retrieval process enhances learning, and begins to form chunks.
- Recall it outside the study session: Try to recall the information when you're away from the source, when you're doing other activities.

### Motivation

Learning something that interests you is easy. What are you'r top three songs? Why do you can quickly recall the name, the band, the lyrics? When we like something, we release dopamine, and this has a powerful effect on learning; we associate this with a good feeling, and we "train" ourselves.

### Creating a library of chunks

Expertise is having a large repository of chunks, and using them in new ways. When you gain one chunk, you may discover that it is related to chunks you already know, so you make new connections with the new chunk. This allows to discover new solutions to novel problems. This also helps learn new chunks more easily when they are related to other chunks in our mind.

### Over-learning

This a useful concept; when you try to keep learning after you mastered a concept, you may end up with an automaticity; you automatically think, or do, that thing.

But repeating something that you know it may make you think that you mastered the topic, and you are not learning new things. It also may cause to focus extremely into that thing, and everything starts to look like a nail if what you only have is a hammer.

Interleaving is the act of change the topic, or the problem, and skipping around between topics. This helps with over-learning.

### Procrastination and memory

Building chunks in long-term memory is not the thing that can be completed at the last minute. Learning is a bit by bit activity; you want to avoid cramming information. Chunking is related to habit; a habit is there because it has a:

- Cue: What does make you start the habit?
- Routine: What you do after the cue?
- Reward: The routine makes you feel better.

To beat the uncomfortable feeling of doing something, instead of procrastinate, try focusing on the process rather than in the product. For example, focus on putting the best effort in a period of time, not on what you need to achieve.

To override a habit, you need to manage the parts of an habit:

- Cue: Try not to have things that may give you a cue, like turning off you'r phone.
- Routine: Remove the items that fuel the distraction.
- Reward: Of course! Reward the good habit.

### Diving into memory

We evolved to retain general clues about what we see. After all, it is useful for us to remember where those tasty berries were last time, doesn't it? This visual memory can be used to our advantage. Connect images to concepts; images help encapsulate hard to remember concepts by using the visual part of the brain. Recalling this image and what it represents helps transport this concept from the working memory to long lasting memory.

Some techniques:

- Creating Meaningful Groups: Try to create a sentence where each word starts with the character of the thing you want to memorize, for example: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism (The 4 pillars of OOP) can be "Ants Eat In Pairs".

- Memory Palace: Put things in a imaginary place, like your house. Let's say you put in your room a Picasso. Then, when revisiting this imaginary room, you will recall "Aha! Abstraction".
