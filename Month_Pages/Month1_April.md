This month was a lot to take in.

## How computers work

In this book I learned a lot how we may build a computer from the ground up. We started with how we may use a communications system to talk to our friend, and then how we may create some kind of code to transmit this messages more quickly. This let us learn about electricity, how we may construct circuits and how the work. Something it really stick with me was how we use the earth as a really big conductor; I studied circuits in college but I didn't really understand that part until now. From here, we creates some simple circuits with a cable and a lightbulb (well, two lightbulbs), so when our friend saw that lightbulb blink in his bedroom, and knew the code needed to understand the message, then he could tell what we were trying to tell him. From here, I learned how we may apply this idea to create the telegram. A telegram is constructed from relays, and we may put cables across the ocean to communicate over large distances. Then, I learned about numerical systems in other base than ten (10), and how the binary numerical system is used for computers because it is so simple to reproduce in reality. I learned about the bits, and how voltage levels corresponds to states, and how we may use those states to create logic gates from switches. Remember the relays? Those were switches in a sense, and so we learned how we may construct logic gates that can do logic operations with voltage levels. For example, we may create a gate that only outputs a HIGH logic level when both it's inputs are one. From here, we construct an adder from those logic gates; a circuit that adds numbers that are in binary. This, of course, leads us to construct a more complex circuit that also subtracts. Now, we have a circuit that can do operations over numbers, but now we need where to store them: that's where the flip-flop enters. Flip-flops can store a bit using *feedback*, this means that the output of the circuit takes part in the input of the same circuit. Since we have now where to store those bits, we need a better representation of them. Here we learn about hexadecimal and bytes; hexadecimal lets us represent bytes, because, for example, if we represent 16 bits in octal, and then, we represent those same 16 bits in two parts of 8 bits, the octal representation is *different*. In hexadecimal is the same. With hexadecimal, this representation doesn't change. From here,we understand how we may build an array of flip-flops, and then how to write to them using our little adder/subtractor that we built before. This delves us into how, since the beginning of time, humans always wanted a way to do automated things, and what better candidate than numeric operations? Our brains are not really wired to be computers, so this is extra pleasant. In here, I learned about microprocessors, about control lines and I/O necessary for the processor to get data from us. Here we learn about the numerical representation of characters, and the data bus and how we may isolate each circuit in the data-bus with tristate gates. Then, we learned about a simple operating system, and how that operating system let's you program a microprocessor that has a memory connected to it. I learned about how floating point numbers are represented in binary, and in the computer's memory, and how any language that is not assembly is a high level language. Then, I learned about how, from the text output or the lightbulb output we had since the beginning of the book, we can output images to a screen as to create a *Graphical User Interface*, used to interact with the computer in a more user friendly way.

## Learning how to learn

### Focused and Diffused Thinking

Metaphors help us learn by binding concepts to things we know.

There are two types of thinking:

- Focused: This is where we give something we want to learn all of our attention.
- Diffused: You take a step back, and just think about the general idea. This enables you to let your brain create new ways of thinking, because your mind wanders in those ways.

For example, Dal√≠ let his mind wander with a key in his hand, and when he was about to fall sleep, the falling key would wake him up and he would gather all those diffused thinking ideas and bring them to the focused mode.

To reach this state, it is important to practice. The brain has evolved to help us navigate complex environments, and almost all of this happens in the subconscious, so it is not easy to do it at will.

### Procrastination

The procrastination loop:

- You feel uncomfortable doing the task
- You switch tasks
- You feel better, and remember that that first task make you feel uncomfortable

The Pomodoro tool to beat this: do the task 25 minutes, then reward yourself with 5 minutes of leisure tasks.

### Practice makes permanent

Because concepts sometimes don't have a representation in the real world, it is difficult for us to understand them; like math, we can't see a derivate in the flesh, but we can practice to strengthen the connections in our brains.

The more abstract something is, the more important is to practice it to bring those abstract ideas into reality.

### Introduction to memory

Two concepts:

- Working memory: What you're consciously and immediately processing in your mind.
- Long term memory: Like a storage warehouse. This is where you store concepts that relates with what you're working with today.

### Sleep and learning

Sleep is the way for the brain to clean itself. If you don't sleep, you're learning with a brain that is not working good.
Sleeping allows you to learn better and faster. It consolidates memories into the brain, so that they pass from the working memory to the long term memory.

### Testimonies

In this section of the course, I learned about how different people learn, how they apply the information of this course and changed the way they learn. Each one of them had a different history to tell, and I really enjoyed reading them.

### Introduction to chunking

A chunk is the result of grouping bits of information together, and give meaning to them. This makes easier the chunk to integrate with new information we're learning. Focusing the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of learning. This chunk is meant to be recalled smoothly when we want to use it, and this is achieved via practice and repetition.

A chunk is a little piece of something that it is easy to remember. Then, you can group more chunks to to reach the concept, or the song, or that something you want to learn.

Steps for chunking:

- Focus learn the information you want to chunk.
- Understand the basic idea to chunk.
- Gain context on when you can use this chunk, via practice.

### Illusions of competence

Illusions of competence means that we may trick us into thinking that we are learning when in reality we just associate, for example, having a book in front of us with learning.

There are some tips for really learning:

- Recalling: Read a text and try to recall it. Then read it again and try to recall it again. The retrieval process enhances learning, and begins to form chunks.
- Recall it outside the study session: Try to recall the information when you're away from the source, when you're doing other activities.

### Motivation

Learning something that interests you is easy. What are you'r top three songs? Why do you can quickly recall the name, the band, the lyrics? When we like something, we release dopamine, and this has a powerful effect on learning; we associate this with a good feeling, and we "train" ourselves.

### Creating a library of chunks

Expertise is having a large repository of chunks, and using them in new ways. When you gain one chunk, you may discover that it is related to chunks you already know, so you make new connections with the new chunk. This allows to discover new solutions to novel problems. This also helps learn new chunks more easily when they are related to other chunks in our mind.

### Over-learning

This a useful concept; when you try to keep learning after you mastered a concept, you may end up with an automaticity; you automatically think, or do, that thing.

But repeating something that you know it may make you think that you mastered the topic, and you are not learning new things. It also may cause to focus extremely into that thing, and everything starts to look like a nail if what you only have is a hammer.

Interleaving is the act of change the topic, or the problem, and skipping around between topics. This helps with over-learning.

### Procrastination and memory

Building chunks in long-term memory is not the thing that can be completed at the last minute. Learning is a bit by bit activity; you want to avoid cramming information. Chunking is related to habit; a habit is there because it has a:

- Cue: What does make you start the habit?
- Routine: What you do after the cue?
- Reward: The routine makes you feel better.

To beat the uncomfortable feeling of doing something, instead of procrastinate, try focusing on the process rather than in the product. For example, focus on putting the best effort in a period of time, not on what you need to achieve.

To override a habit, you need to manage the parts of an habit:

- Cue: Try not to have things that may give you a cue, like turning off you'r phone.
- Routine: Remove the items that fuel the distraction.
- Reward: Of course! Reward the good habit.

### Diving into memory

We evolved to retain general clues about what we see. After all, it is useful for us to remember where those tasty berries were last time, doesn't it? This visual memory can be used to our advantage. Connect images to concepts; images help encapsulate hard to remember concepts by using the visual part of the brain. Recalling this image and what it represents helps transport this concept from the working memory to long lasting memory.

Some techniques:

- Creating Meaningful Groups: Try to create a sentence where each word starts with the character of the thing you want to memorize, for example: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism (The 4 pillars of OOP) can be "Ants Eat In Pairs".

- Memory Palace: Put things in a imaginary place, like your house. Let's say you put in your room a Picasso. Then, when revisiting this imaginary room, you will recall "Aha! Abstraction".

### How to become a better learner

Here are some tips to learn better:

- Create visual analogies for the concepts you want to learn
- People learn better by practicing the pathways those concepts store in the brain: This means to repeat and test the concepts.
- Try to enter diffuse mode after a study session, to strengthen the pathways in the brain
- Genius people tend to hold too much things onto out short term memory; this makes them more resistant to different perspectives
- Working with more people let's you understand the topic better, but only if it really is about studying.
