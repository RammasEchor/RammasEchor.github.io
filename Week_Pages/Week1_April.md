# Week 1 - Innovation & hard/smart work

## 05 Apr 2021 - 09 Apr 2021

---

This week I learned a lot about Encora, mostly about different departments. What's more,
I learned from various readings and videos about different topics and techniques, and
here I will try to condense my takeaway from everything I learned this week.

### How to create the correct environment and the steps to success in a human conversation (or how to talk to anyone)

At the beginning of this reading I was expecting some kind of motivational message such as
"You can do it!", but I was surprised to find specific techniques and how to implement them
into a conversation to appear more charismatic. My main takeaway is that you need to listen to your audience, learn what keeps them engaged and drive the conversation to that.

### Profound life lessons from a University Professor

- Focus on making simple projects that just work.

> "Early optimization is the root of all evil". - Donald Knuth  

This quote doesn't appear in the reading, but it was something that I read some time
ago, and I think it fits the topic.  

- Intuition works great if you need a place to start analyzing, not so great if you
want to solve a problem only with that; "Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them".  
- It's best to create something new that to adapt something to your needs, but this is
not always possible, mainly because it is more work to do so.  
- Construct general rules over
facts, and examples always makes life easier.  
- A problem is not fixed until you had researched
and reached the cause. Don't try to give the impression that you know everything, it is okay
to say "I don't know".
- Coherent systems tend to be unstable; because you only expect your
system to behave one way, when something happens everything tends to crash. But coherent systems
are more efficient.

### An idea is worth nothing if is not executed

You could have the best idea about an start-up, or the next big social media, but
you need to pour your sweat into them for that idea to reach it's full potential.
Even if it fails, an idea multiplied per one is better than an idea multiplied per zero.

### The shell

An interface doesn't let you press a button that is not there, and you can not give the
computer a voice command that is not programmed. To take full advantage of all computer's
tools, we have to use the text-based interface called the shell. The most common used shell
is the bourne-again shell (bash).
This lecture gives an overview of the most used bash commands, like `cd`, `ls`, `echo`, etc., with
a little side of redirection and pipes.

### Why autopilot is the worst thing ever (and the best)

I learned a lot from this reading, and it was my favorite reading from the week.
Autopilot is something that our brain uses to avoid being overwhelmed with all the
decisions needed for each day, or even hour. But autopilot is creeping into our lives,
and it is not good. It makes us ignore other aspects of our lives that are as important, and often more. I learned about the various types of autopilot, and action points
to help us manage that autopilot. Once we have become aware of our own autopilots, then
we can start changing them. Taking three steps (Leading our life, deepening connections,
and becoming part of the community) assures that we manage the autopilot.

### How to apply the x-workflow to any problem

In this reading I learned about the methodology known as *x-workflow*.
My main takeaway is that we solve problems in a way that resembles throwing balls of mud to a wall and seeing which one stuck better; this process generates more problems and errors, and even if it works, you don't learn. This is where the x-workflow enters;
It is a series
of steps used to identify a problems cause, and how to research solutions; this last steps
involves the implementation and posterior analysis of the solution; more importantly,
you learned everything about the problem in the process.

### Religion, evolution, and the ecstasy of self-transcendence

The main reason people considerate themselves to be spiritual in one way or another.
Sometimes, something happens that triggers a state of heightened consciousness. The capacity
of self-transcendence is a part of being human. Group selection may be a valid evolutionary path,
where the cooperative group triumphs over a group that is not coherent. But the cooperative group
must solve the free-riders problem (subjects in a group that don't cooperate but free-rides the success
of the group) in order to reap the benefits of cooperation. Nature solved this problem in a brutal way; if you don't
cooperate, your group and you die. But if group selection is true, that means that we evolved to be cooperative, to be
part of something greater. Self-transcendence is to be in the state of heightened consciousness that
allows us to infer this.

### Creative Thinking Hacks

Creating something is an active process. Removing unnecessary constraints based on assumptions makes your solutions
more creative. The correct environment, such as taking a walk, can greatly help in the problem solving process.
Persistence means working hard AND working smart.

- Write down ideas
- Escape: Let your subconscious mind speak, usually happens when in quiet places.
- Invert: Try to solve the opposite problem, like, how could I make this problem worse.
- Partner with a person
- Fail: If you're not failing, that means that you're not taking enough risks to be creative
- Switch: Find a new way to represent the problem

### How progress really happens

When we think about change, we think about what tool or technology is going to make that happen.
This is the wrong way of thinking; there is not change until someone stakes their reputation in
doing something different. But change is difficult because it requires work, thinking, raises questions,
and it puts us at risk of embarrassment. And then, after we commit to a change, we need three things:

- Power: What can I change?
- Persuasion: What support?
- Intuition: What can I anticipate?

### How to Master Anything

Without practice and the need to improve, people with experience could be on the same level
or even worse compared with someone with less experience but that keeps learning. Mastery
comes from practice, and more specifically, the ability of representing experiences in mind
that relates to the actual situation. This ability comes from practice.

### Making badass developers

We are not computers; our cognitive resources are limited. We work, and then we are tired, and need
food and rest. We need to manage this cognitive resources, and the best way is to automate certain
tasks. The problem lies in the difficulty of setting those tasks in autopilot, because we first need
to learn and waste cognitive resources in them. Some way to learn the desired tasks and set them to autopilot
without wasting too much resources is to watch high-quality examples in high-quantity and let our subconscious
brain do the heavy lifting; finding patterns and the overall technique.

## Conclusions

This week I learned that I have some ideas that are plainly wrong. The readings and the
videos made me identify preconceived ideas I had about how things should be that are/were wrong, but that there is always room for improvement. The topics were varied, but I learned a little bit of everything, and I really enjoyed *learning* everything I *learned*. Much of
the topics were directly related to learning, and creating new things, and taking a
step back and finding a new perspective, and they were really effective in teaching me
some things I didn't know, and some things I already knew but I had the wrong approach to them.
