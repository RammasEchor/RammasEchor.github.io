## Performance interview

This week I had my performance interview. Since about 4 weeks ago I started reviewing the topics for this interview, and this week I did not learn a lot of new things. I do not have received feedback from the interview yet, but I think my performance was average. I am really not happy with this, since I sinked a lot of time studying, but I realized that I need to better myself so I can be at the level I want to be. During the interview I was nervous, and did wander when coming up with answers.

I need to be more confident in my answers, and for me to be more confident I need to know the topic very, very well. To reach this I need to comprehend not only the general strokes, but memorize the concepts for each part. I know how, and why, but hearing a name I haven't heard trips me out, and I know that if I knew the concept it would be much more easier.

I know that memorization is not a technique for learning, but I think that in my case it can help me a lot.

## Coding problems

This week I solved some coding problems, but they took me some time, so I need to be faster. I also need to come up with better solutions, because I have been having problems with time constraints.

## Interviewmania  straggler topics

### Software Engineering

The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.

### Programming paradigms

A way to classify programming languages based on their features.

- Imperative: The programmer tells the machine how to change its state
  - Procedural: Groups instructions into procedures
  - Object Oriented: Groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on
- Declarative: The programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
  - Functional: The desired result is declared as the value of a series of functions applications
  - Logic: In which the result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules
  - Mathematical: The desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
  - Reactive: The desired results is declared with data streams and the propagation of change
