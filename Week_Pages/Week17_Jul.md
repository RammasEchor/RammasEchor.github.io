## Liberating the Musician Within

To Kenny Werner, the idea of perfection is celebrating mistakes. Start from nowhere, and don't try to do everything perfect the first time. The fear of mistakes is what stuns creativity. An action taken is a success. An action not taken because of fear of failure is a failure.

If you are able to experiment with no need of success, but connecting with the flow, you'll probably would have a whole lot of success.

Let go of the control of results. There is a technique, "detachment", where you distance yourself from the action, from your hands, and just let them move. For me, this is reached after a ton of practice, and when you stop judging what is going to come out from that, you *create*.

## The inner game of tennis

Every game is composed of two parts; and outer game and an inner game. The player of the inner game comes to value the art of relaxed concentration above all other skills.

The inner game has a state, an unconscious state that lets you detach from the outer game, and let you play in a curious state of mind. In this state, you don't think, don't try, don't really focus in the individual actions. You just go with the flow. Entering this state requires slowing down the mind. Quieting the mind is a gradual process involving the learning of several inner skills:

- Nonjudgemental awareness: See events as they are, without labeling them. Judgement results in tightness. Relaxation produces smooth movements.
- Picture the desired outcome.
- Trust your body to do the things, without conscious effort to change.
- Nonjudgemental observation of change and results.

Fighting the mind does not work. What works best is learning to focus it. How? By practice.

## Navy Seal Motivation

1. Identify weaknesses: How? Search for your limits. Then, you can work on them.
2. Identify what matters: Sometimes you focus on things that really don't give value to you, or what you want to accomplish. Try to see the bigger picture.
3. Learn from mistakes: What went wrong? What steps I need to take to avoid that in the future? How I can be better?
4. Just do more: If you have time, do more to stay ahead.
5. Make a change: With what you learned making mistakes, apply it.
6. Be a good leader: Don't be offensive when you take ownership.
7. Be well rounded: Don't try to be just one thing. People are looking for those special kinds of people than can be good communicators and excel at what they do.
8. Question leadership: Raise your hand if you think something's wrong.
9. Get disciplined: What you are doing today will affect your future.
10. Learn to deal with stress: How not to let yourself be buried by you can't change.

## Asleep in a minute

This technique is supposed to calm you down, to slow down your body. It works as follows:

1. Inhale for 4 seconds.
2. While you keep counting, hold your breath until 7.
3. Exhale for 8 seconds, forcefully and making a whoosh sound.
4. Repeat.

I will try it out tonight, and maybe I will find it useful.
