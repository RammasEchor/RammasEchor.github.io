# Week 10 - Open source / Read others people's code (1)

## 08 Jun 2021 - 14 Jun 2021

---

Hi! This week in Academy we kicked off the phase *Open source / Read others people's code*. This week I answered two questions of three about open source projects by reading their code. I also learned about some general guidelines about contributing to open source projects. Here is what I learned this week:

## How to contribute to open source

This is a quick lecture about general guidelines.

### Why contribute to open source?

There are a variety of reasons why contributing to open source is a good idea;

- Improve software you rely on
- Improve your skills
- Find mentors and teach others
- All your open source is public, which means that you may show as a demonstration of what you can do.

### What it means to contribute?

You don't have to contribute code; in fact, it is often the other parts of the project (documentation, translations) that are the most neglected.

But code is also fine.

### Anatomy of a open source project

Every open source community is different, but many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure:

- Author: Creator of the project
- Owner: Not always the same as the author, is the person with administrative ownership over the organization or repository
- Maintainers: Contributors that drive the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project
- Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project
- Community members: People who use the project

A project also has documentation:

- License: *Open source license*
- README: Instruction manual that welcome new community members
- CONTRIBUTING: This helps people to find ways to contribute to the project
- Code of conduct: Rules for participants
- Other documentation

And finally, open source projects may use tools to organize themselves:

- Issue tracker
- Pull requests
- Forums or mailing lists
- Chat channel

### Finding a project to contribute on

There is a fairly long list of recommendations to check when searching for a open source project. Summary is listed below:

- Meet the definition of open source
- Actively accepts contributions
- Is welcoming

### How to submit a contribution

#### Communicate effectively

Before opening an issue of pull request, keep some points in mind to help come across your ideas effectively:

- Give context: Make sure the other person knows what you are talking about without making them search for it if it is not necessary.
- Homework: Show that you tried to understand what you are asking.
- Keep requests short and direct: Be concise, and don't waste peoples time.
- Keep all communications public: Don't reach privately, what you are asking may help more people in the future.
- It is okay to ask questions.
- Respect community decisions.
- **Keep it classy**

#### Gather context

Check to make sure your idea hasn't been already discussed. Search for a few key terms. Before opening an issue or pull request, check the projects contributing docs to see how things are done.

### After the submit

You may not receive a response, tasked to rework the contribution, get rejected, and better, get accepted. This is normal, and don't get discouraged if it happens to you. Remember, whatever happens, keep it classy and respect the decision being made.

## Open Source Questions

This phase we were tasked to answer three questions about open source projects. One question was chosen from a set of questions, and the other two should be made by us. These questions "should elicit deep understanding of the project", and there should be a question per primary and secondary stack. Here are the questions I will be answering this phase:

### How does a consumer gets a message in Apache Kafka?

### How does *npm* parse the *package.json* file?

### How does the mongodb go driver handle authentication?

*In progress...*

## Random what I learned

- `Alt`(option in macOS) `+ Z` in vs code activates line wrap
- `Show suggestions` in vs code in macOS has the keybinding `ctrl + space`, but macOS already has this mapped to change input keyboard. Changing this keybinding to `cmd + space` makes it work.
- `Blockman` vs code extension works as a charm; better looking than `Colorized brackets`, but you need to fine tune the colors if you have a custom theme.
- The `Remote Repository` extension was useful to me; allowed me to quickly search in a repo without cloning it.
